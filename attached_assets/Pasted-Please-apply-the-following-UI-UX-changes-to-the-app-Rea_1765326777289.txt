Please apply the following UI/UX changes to the app (React + Tailwind). Keep existing patterns and components; just adjust.

1. Sidebar (make it smaller, remove company name)

Reduce sidebar width further:

Make the left navigation column noticeably narrower than it is now.

Keep icons + labels, but adjust Tailwind width / padding so it takes up less horizontal space (more room for the main content).

Remove the company name from the top-left corner:

In the sidebar header where “Samcor Mechanical Inc.” (or any company name) is rendered, remove that text completely.

If there is a logo element, you can keep a small logo or icon, but no long text brand name there.

Keep the Settings and Admin items exactly as they are now in terms of order and behaviour (just narrower sidebar overall).

2. Global spacing / gaps between content and sidebar

On the Job page (and ideally across main layouts):

Reduce the horizontal gap between:

The sidebar border and the main content column.

The left main column and the right column of cards.

Reduce vertical gaps between cards in the right column:

Notes, Invoices, Visits, Equipment, Activity, Metadata, etc., should have a smaller space-y-* / margin between them.

Leave a small gap so cards don’t touch, but make the column feel tighter and more unified than it is now.

Keep internal card padding as-is (so content still feels roomy), but cut down the space between cards and between columns.

3. Cost & Price fields in Parts & Billing

In the Parts & Billing table on the Job page:

For the Cost and Price inputs:

Remove the default value 0 / 0.00 from the actual field value.

When empty, the inputs should be blank.

Remove the browser’s number stepper arrows (up/down arrows) so users can’t increment with tiny arrows; they will just type values.

Use a currency-style placeholder:

Placeholder text should be a faded 0.00.

Prepend a $ visually (either via CSS, pseudo-element, or input group pattern) so both fields clearly look like dollar amounts.

Keep these inputs numeric on the backend/validation, but visually they should look like “money fields” with a subtle placeholder and no stepper arrows.

4. Status widget cleanup (top-right of Job page)

In the top-right “Status / Priority / Scheduled” card on the Job page:

Currently status shows something like:
Status scheduled [Scheduled ▼]
This is redundant.

Change it so:

Only one representation of the status is shown, using the existing dropdown.

For example, show:
Status [Scheduled ▼]
(No extra status pill or duplicate label next to it.)

Keep Priority and Scheduled date/time as they are, just ensure Status isn’t duplicated.

5. Header job ID duplication

Near the top of the Job page you currently have:

In the breadcrumb: Jobs / #10134

Then just below: Job #10134 again.

We only need the job number once.

Keep the breadcrumb as: Jobs / #10134 (so the user can click “Jobs” to go back).

Remove the separate “Job #10134” text line below the breadcrumb.

Keep the actual job title (e.g., “remove ladder from mud room 222222”) as the main title.

6. Any other minor cleanups (use judgment)

If, while doing this, you see any obviously inconsistent padding/margins or font sizes on this page (vs the client/location pages we already aligned), you can lightly normalize them so:

Job page header fonts match the style used on the Client and Location pages.

Main title, breadcrumb, and right-side status card line up visually.

Please summarize at the end which files/components you changed (e.g. Job layout, Parts & Billing row component, Sidebar layout, Status card component), and briefly mention how you handled:

Sidebar width + removal of company name.

Cost/Price input behaviour (no default 0, no stepper, currency placeholder).

Gaps between sidebar/main and between cards.

Status duplication removal.

Job ID duplication removal.
