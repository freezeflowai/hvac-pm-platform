You are helping me refactor the EXISTING Job Detail page in my HVAC dispatch app.

I’ve already implemented a job page with:

- Header: Job ID, job title (e.g. “Job #10134 – Maintenance Job”), priority pill.
- A status strip with stages like Draft, Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, Invoiced, Hold, Cancel.
- A blue “Start Job” button in the header (I want to remove this).
- Main sections:
  - Job Details card
  - Location card
  - Assigned Technicians card
  - Equipment card
  - Parts & Billing card
  - Activity card
  - Metadata card

Use the existing tech stack, components, and styling. Do NOT add new frameworks. Refactor the current Job Detail component/layout rather than building a brand new page.

The goal is to:
- Remove “start/stop job” from this admin/office view.
- Keep only **status changes** as the way to control job state.
- Simplify the layout to a **two-column structure** that reduces scrolling and groups related information.

------------------------------------------------
1) REMOVE START/STOP CONTROLS FROM HEADER
------------------------------------------------

Currently there is a “Start Job” button in the header area.

Change this so that:

- The header only shows:
  - Job ID and title (e.g., “Job #10134 – Maintenance Job”)
  - Priority pill (Low / Medium / High)
  - Status control (either the existing status strip or a cleaned up status dropdown/strip)
  - Secondary actions like:
    - Edit Job
    - Delete/Cancel job (if allowed)
- The **“Start Job”** button and any similar “Stop Job” or timer buttons must be removed from this page. Techs will manage live job state in a separate mobile/tech UI, not here.

Status behavior:

- Keep the ability to update status (Draft, Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, Invoiced, Hold, Cancel) from this page.
- This can remain as the existing status strip or a simplified status dropdown, but there should be **no “start/stop” workflow buttons**.

------------------------------------------------
2) CHANGE LAYOUT TO TWO COLUMNS
------------------------------------------------

Convert the main content into a consistent **two-column layout**:

- **Left column**: primary job information and billing
- **Right column**: context (location, technicians, equipment, activity, metadata)

Maintain responsiveness according to current breakpoints, but on desktop the intent is:

LEFT (wider, main):

1. **Job Details card**
   - Job Type
   - Summary
   - Description
   - Access Instructions
   - Scheduled Start
   - Scheduled End
   - (Optional) Actual Start/End if present

2. **Parts & Billing card**
   - Parts Added (count)
   - Invoice Status (e.g., Not Created / Created / Synced)
   - Billing Notes
   - Buttons:
     - “Add Parts”
     - If invoice not created: “Create Invoice”
     - If invoice exists: “View Invoice”
   - This card should sit directly under Job Details in the left column.

RIGHT (narrower, supporting):

1. **Location card**
   - Location name
   - Client/company if available
   - Address (if available)
   - “View Location Details” button

2. **Assigned Technicians card**
   - If none assigned:
     - Show a clear message: “No technicians assigned yet.”
     - “Assign Technician” button.
   - If some assigned:
     - List technician names.
     - Keep the “Assign” action in the corner as currently designed.

3. **Equipment card**
   - Title: Equipment
   - If none linked:
     - Message: “No equipment linked to this job.”
     - If the location has equipment, text can say: “You can link equipment registered at this location.”
   - “Add Equipment” button in the top-right of the card.
   - If equipment is linked:
     - Show a simple list (name, type/model).

4. **Activity card**
   - Activity log list (e.g. “Job created on [date]”).
   - Use the existing activity implementation.

5. **Metadata card**
   - Created date
   - Job ID
   - Optionally last updated date if available.

Place these right-column cards stacked in this order: Location → Assigned Technicians → Equipment → Activity → Metadata.

------------------------------------------------
3) CLEAN UP VISUAL CLUTTER
------------------------------------------------

- Ensure card spacing and margins are consistent; avoid too much vertical whitespace between cards.
- Make sure headings (“Job Details”, “Assigned Technicians”, “Equipment”, “Parts & Billing”, “Activity”, “Metadata”) use the same typography as the rest of the app.
- The overall feeling should be:
  - Top header (full width).
  - Two-column body:
    - Left = work you do on the job.
    - Right = supporting info.

------------------------------------------------
4) INTERACTION BEHAVIOR (UNCHANGED OR LIGHTLY TWEAKED)
------------------------------------------------

- Changing status still calls the same backend update used before.
- Assign Technician button behavior stays the same (uses existing API to assign techs).
- Add Equipment button should trigger the same equipment-linking flow that already existed (or stub if it’s not fully implemented yet).
- Parts & Billing card should remain wired to the existing parts/invoice state (even if some pieces are placeholders).

------------------------------------------------
WHAT TO DELIVER
------------------------------------------------

Update the Job Detail page implementation to:

1. Remove any “Start Job” / “Stop Job” style controls from this page; status changes remain as the only control of job state.
2. Implement a two-column layout:
   - Left: Job Details, Parts & Billing cards.
   - Right: Location, Assigned Technicians, Equipment, Activity, Metadata cards in that order.
3. Ensure visual cleanup and spacing so the page feels less overwhelming and requires less vertical scrolling on desktop.
4. Preserve all existing functionality (status updates, technician assignment, equipment adding, billing notes, etc.), just reorganized into the new layout.

Use the project’s existing layout/grid system and UI components so the refactor feels native and consistent.
