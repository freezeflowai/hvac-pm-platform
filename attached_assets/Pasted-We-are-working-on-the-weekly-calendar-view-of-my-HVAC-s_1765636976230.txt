We are working on the weekly calendar view of my HVAC scheduling app. I’ve attached a screenshot of the current layout. I want to simplify the visuals and fix the time-slot behavior. Please carefully implement the following changes.

========================================
PART 1 – REMOVE OVERDUE DOTS + OVERDUE LABELS FROM CALENDAR
========================================

Right now, jobs and unscheduled jobs are showing a red “overdue” dot and overdue text in the calendar and in the Unscheduled sidebar.

I want to completely remove the “overdue” indicators from the calendar UI:

1. On the main calendar grid:
   - Remove any red dot or overdue icon from job cards.
   - Job cards should no longer display an “overdue” visual state in the calendar view.

2. In the Unscheduled sidebar (right-hand column):
   - Remove the red dot from the job cards.
   - Remove or hide any “Overdue Nov ’25” style text from these cards.
   - The unscheduled list should simply show the job title, location, and (optionally) due date in a subtle way, but WITHOUT red overdue styling.

We will handle “overdue” awareness in the Jobs list or Dashboard later, so do not show overdue on the calendar at all.

========================================
PART 2 – SHRINK THE UNSCHEDULED SIDEBAR WIDTH
========================================

The Unscheduled column on the right is currently too wide for the content and wastes horizontal space that we need for the calendar.

Please:

1. Reduce the width of the Unscheduled sidebar to roughly half of what it is now.
   - If it is currently using something like 20–25% of the layout width, change it to around 10–13%.
   - Use a fixed min width so it doesn’t collapse too small (e.g. `min-width: 260px`), but keep it as narrow as is comfortable.

2. Keep the job cards inside that sidebar readable by:
   - Using the compact job-card styling we already defined (small padding, 12–13px text, tight line height).
   - Ensuring long titles truncate with an ellipsis instead of wrapping to 3–4 lines.

3. The main calendar area should expand to use the space freed from the narrower sidebar.

========================================
PART 3 – SLIGHTLY NARROWER LEFT NAVIGATION SIDEBAR
========================================

The left navigation menu (Dashboard / Jobs / Invoices / Calendar / etc.) is also slightly wider than it needs to be.

Update its layout so that:

- It uses a smaller fixed width (for example 210–220px) instead of a larger width.
- Icons and labels still fit comfortably, but the sidebar feels more compact.
- The extra space should be given to the main calendar area (center column).

If you are using CSS grid or flex for the overall shell, adjust the grid columns so the ratios are approximately:
- ~12–13% width for the left sidebar
- ~72–75% width for the calendar
- ~10–13% width for the Unscheduled sidebar (from Part 2)

Use responsive behavior so that:
- On smaller screens, the right sidebar can collapse or turn into a drawer, as already implemented.
- The left nav can also collapse to icons-only or a hamburger menu, if that behavior already exists.

========================================
PART 4 – ENABLE TRUE 15-MINUTE INCREMENT DRAGGING
========================================

Right now, when I drag a job card up or down on the calendar, it will only snap into full-hour blocks (e.g. from 11:00 directly to 12:00). I need it to support 15-minute increments (11:00, 11:15, 11:30, 11:45, etc.), matching the vertical grid.

Requirements:

1. Time grid:
   - The calendar day columns should internally represent time in 15-minute increments.
   - Define a constant like `const SLOT_MINUTES = 15` and `const PX_PER_MINUTE = (rowHeight / 60)` where `rowHeight` is the pixel height of an hour.

2. Drag behavior for moving a job:
   - When dragging a job card vertically:
     - Convert the vertical delta (deltaY in pixels) to minutes using `deltaMinutes = deltaY / PX_PER_MINUTE`.
     - Snap this to 15-minute increments using something like:
       `const snappedMinutes = Math.round(deltaMinutes / SLOT_MINUTES) * SLOT_MINUTES;`
     - Compute the new start time:
       `newStart = originalStart + snappedMinutes`.
   - While dragging, show the job at its snapped vertical position.
   - On drop, update the job’s `startsAt` (and `endsAt` based on its duration) in state and persist it via the existing API.

3. Interaction with resize:
   - Keep the resize-from-bottom behavior we already discussed previously for changing duration.
   - Make sure both dragging and resizing use the same 15-minute snapping logic so there are no weird off-grid times.

4. Constraints:
   - Prevent dragging outside the working hours range for that day (if such a range exists).
   - Optionally enforce a minimum job duration (e.g. 15 or 30 minutes).

========================================
PART 5 – SMALL VISUAL REFINEMENTS
========================================

While applying the changes above, also:

1. Ensure the Unscheduled sidebar header (e.g. “Unscheduled (15)”) remains visible and aligned nicely after we shrink the width.
2. Maintain the existing ability to show multiple jobs side-by-side in the main calendar when times overlap; the layout changes must not break that behavior.
3. Verify that drag-and-drop and resizing still work correctly after we alter the column widths.

========================================
DELIVERABLES
========================================

Please:
- Update the layout/container code for the calendar shell (left sidebar, main calendar, right Unscheduled sidebar) to reflect the new widths.
- Update the job card and unscheduled card styling for a more compact look.
- Implement the 15-minute snapping logic for dragging job cards vertically, reusing the same snapping constants used for duration resizing.
- Remove all overdue-related dots/labels from the calendar and Unscheduled sidebar.

Show me:
- The key updated React components (calendar layout, job event rendering, unscheduled list).
- Any updated CSS/Tailwind classes or inline styles.
- The helper functions/hooks used to convert between pixels and 15-minute time slots and to snap times correctly.
