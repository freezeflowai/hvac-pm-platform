You are helping me refine the **Job Templates** feature in my HVAC dispatch app.

Context (current state):

- There is a Settings → Job Templates screen that:
  - Shows an empty state when no templates exist.
  - Has a job type filter dropdown with values: All Types, Service Call, PM, Install, Repair, Inspection.
  - Has a “New Template” button that opens a “New Job Template” modal.

- The “New Job Template” modal includes:
  - Fields:
    - Name (required)
    - Description
    - Job Type dropdown with: None, Service Call, PM, Install, Repair, Inspection
    - Active checkbox
  - A line items table with columns:
    - Product / Service (dropdown)
    - Description Override
    - Qty
    - Unit Price
    - Delete row
  - A drag handle column on the left for row reordering.

- On the backend we have:
  - JobTemplate and JobTemplateLineItem entities as previously defined.
  - Items (products/services) API for populating the Product / Service dropdown.
  - JobTemplates API for create/update/list/deactivate, etc. (or at least basic CRUD already wired up).

I want you to refine both the **UI and behavior** with the following improvements.

------------------------------------------------
1) JOB TYPE – ADD “OTHER”
------------------------------------------------

Update the job type enum / options used in:

- The job type filter on the Job Templates list page.
- The Job Type dropdown inside the “New / Edit Job Template” modal.

Changes:

1. Append an **“Other”** option to the predefined types.

So the options should be:

- For filter:
  - All Types
  - Service Call
  - PM
  - Install
  - Repair
  - Inspection
  - Other

- For template Job Type selection:
  - None
  - Service Call
  - PM
  - Install
  - Repair
  - Inspection
  - Other

On the backend, store jobType as a string (e.g. "service_call", "pm", "install", "repair", "inspection", "other") or keep whatever mapping you currently use, but make sure “Other” is supported end-to-end.

------------------------------------------------
2) TEMPLATE LIST – ACTIONS & ACTIVE STATUS
------------------------------------------------

On the Job Templates main list:

- For each template row/card, add:
  - A **Status** indicator: “Active” or “Inactive” (pill or subtle label).
  - An **Actions** menu (3-dot or icon row) with:
    - Edit
    - Activate / Deactivate (toggle based on current isActive)
    - Duplicate (Clone)
    - Delete (optional hard delete; show confirm modal)

Behavior:

- **Activate / Deactivate**
  - Calls the existing update endpoint (e.g. PUT /api/job-templates/:id) with `isActive` toggled.
  - The “Show inactive” toggle in the header should:
    - When off: hide inactive templates.
    - When on: show both active and inactive.

- **Delete**
  - If hard delete exists:
    - Show a confirm dialog: “Delete this template permanently? This cannot be undone.”
    - On confirm, call DELETE /api/job-templates/:id (or equivalent).
  - If only soft-delete is supported, you can omit hard delete or simply wire Delete to set isActive = false with appropriate wording (“Deactivate”).

- **Duplicate**
  - Calls a new API or reuses existing one to clone:
    - JobTemplate fields (except id and timestamps).
    - All JobTemplateLineItems.
  - Suggested behavior:
    - Name: original name + " (Copy)" by default.
    - New template is created as Active.
  - After cloning:
    - Either:
      - Open the cloned template in the edit modal, OR
      - Leave user on the list and show a toast “Template duplicated.”
  - Implement the clone either:
    - Via a dedicated endpoint (e.g. POST /api/job-templates/:id/clone), OR
    - In the frontend by fetching the template and posting a new one (your choice, just keep it consistent with the rest of the app).

------------------------------------------------
3) LINE ITEMS – SEARCHABLE PRODUCT / SERVICE SELECT
------------------------------------------------

Currently, the “Product / Service” field is a simple dropdown. Change it into a **searchable combobox** with type-ahead and keyboard support.

Requirements:

- User should be able to **type** into the input to filter products/services.
- For large item catalogs:
  - Only load or show options after the user has typed at least 2 characters.
  - Use server-side filtering via the existing `/api/items` endpoint, e.g. `/api/items?search=...`.
- Show results with:
  - Item name
  - Optionally SKU in muted text
- Support:
  - Arrow key navigation
  - Enter to select

When an item is selected:

- The row should store the `itemId`.
- If Unit Price is currently empty:
  - Prefill Unit Price with the item’s default unitPrice.
- Optionally, store the item’s default description so we can use it if the description field is left blank.

Make sure the component still integrates cleanly into the line items table and works with row add/remove/reorder.

------------------------------------------------
4) LINE ITEMS – DESCRIPTION FIELD LABEL & HINT
------------------------------------------------

The column currently labeled **“Description Override”** is confusing.

Change:

- Column header text to **“Description”**.
- Under the field (or via tooltip), show a hint:

  - “If left blank, the product’s default description will be used.”

Backend logic:

- Keep the field name as `descriptionOverride` internally if that’s already in the model.
- On application of a template to a job:
  - If descriptionOverride is non-empty, use that.
  - Else, use item.description or item.name.

So the UI reads as a normal “Description” field, but still behaves as an override.

------------------------------------------------
5) TEMPLATE DETAILS – DEFAULT FOR JOB TYPE (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------------

Add a checkbox in the Template Details section:

- Label: **“Use as default template for this job type”**
- Only enable it when a specific Job Type (not None) is selected.

Behavior:

- When checked and template is saved:
  - Backend should ensure this template becomes the **only** default for that jobType.
  - This can be done by:
    - A dedicated endpoint (PATCH /api/job-templates/:id/default) or
    - Logic inside POST/PUT to clear isDefaultForJobType on other templates with same jobType.

- On the Job Templates list:
  - Show a small “Default” tag/pill next to templates that are default for their jobType.

Note: if there is already logic for defaults, just wire this checkbox into it.

------------------------------------------------
6) LINE ITEM QUALITY-OF-LIFE
------------------------------------------------

Make these small adjustments for better UX:

- When the user clicks **Add Line Item**:
  - Create a new row with:
    - Qty = 1 by default.
    - Product / Service = empty.
    - Description = empty.
    - Unit Price = empty (but should be populated when an item is selected).

- Ensure drag-and-drop reordering of rows updates the underlying `sortOrder` (or equivalent). The final order in the editor should match the order applied to jobs and invoices.

------------------------------------------------
7) VALIDATION & WIRING
------------------------------------------------

- Ensure creating/updating templates:
  - Validates that Name is not empty.
  - Validates that there is at least **one line item**, and that each line item has:
    - itemId
    - quantity > 0
- Ensure that:
  - The list respects the job type filter.
  - “Show inactive” toggle works and default is to show only active templates.

------------------------------------------------
WHAT TO DELIVER
------------------------------------------------

1. Updated Job Template list page:
   - Shows status (Active/Inactive).
   - Has actions: Edit, Activate/Deactivate, Duplicate, Delete (if supported).
   - Supports filter by jobType including an “Other” option.
   - “Show inactive” toggle works.

2. Updated New/Edit Job Template modal:
   - Job Type includes “Other”.
   - Optional “Default for this job type” checkbox wired to default logic.
   - Line Items table:
     - Product / Service is a searchable combobox that queries the Items API.
     - Description column is renamed from “Description Override” and has a hint that blank uses the product’s default description.
     - Qty defaults to 1 for new rows.
     - Unit Price auto-fills from the selected product when empty.

3. Any necessary backend changes:
   - Endpoints or service methods to:
     - Toggle isActive.
     - Clone a template.
     - Mark a template as default for its jobType (and unset others).
   - Ensure descriptionOverride and unitPriceOverride still behave correctly when applying templates to jobs.

Keep all code and styling consistent with the existing project conventions.
