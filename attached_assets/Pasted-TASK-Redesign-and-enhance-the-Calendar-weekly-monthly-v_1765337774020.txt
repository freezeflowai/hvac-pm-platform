TASK: Redesign and enhance the Calendar (weekly + monthly) views

We already have working calendar pages (weekly + monthly) with unscheduled jobs on the right and a left sidebar. I want you to refactor and restyle the calendar to improve readability and usability, NOT to rewrite the app from scratch.

Use the existing tech stack and components (React + TypeScript + Tailwind / current style system). Reuse existing data structures for jobs, technicians, and visits.

1. Layout Goals

High-level:

Calendar grid should be the MAIN focus (roughly 70–75% of horizontal space).

Left sidebar should be narrower.

Right “Unscheduled” drawer should be slightly narrower and fully collapsible.

Remove visual clutter and wasted padding / margins.

1.1 Left Sidebar

Reduce the width of the left navigation sidebar by ~20–30%.

Keep the same menu items, but remove the company name/logo text from the top-left on calendar pages so long company names don’t break the layout.

Keep existing items like:

Dashboard

Jobs

Clients

Calendar

Reports

Settings

Admin

Make sure “Settings” stays as its own menu item (do not merge with Admin).

1.2 Main Calendar Area (Weekly + Monthly)

Use more of the horizontal width for the calendar grid:

Reduce the gap between the left calendar edge and the sidebar.

Reduce the gap between the calendar grid and the right drawer.

Reduce the vertical gaps between time rows and between job cards within the same day column.

Implement row-density options for the calendar grid (user-facing toggle near the top-right of the calendar):

Compact

Comfortable

Expanded
This should change row height and vertical padding on job cards.

1.3 Right “Unscheduled” Drawer

Narrow the right drawer by ~15–20%.

Add a collapse/expand chevron at the top-right of the drawer:

Collapsed state: show a narrow vertical tab with a label like “Unscheduled (N)” that can be clicked to reopen.

Keep the unscheduled jobs list scrollable.

Maintain drag-and-drop from unscheduled → calendar.

2. Visual & Interaction Changes
2.1 Job Card Design (Weekly + Monthly)

Improve readability and visual hierarchy for job cards.

Weekly view job card content (inside each time slot):

Top line: Client name (bold)

Second line: short job description OR location nickname.

Third line: optional details like:

#JobNumber • 1h 45m

Use good spacing and font sizes so it’s readable even for people with glasses.

Monthly view job card content:

Shorter variant, example:

Basil Box – PM Visit

On hover or click, show a tooltip/popover with more details (client, address, technician, times).

2.2 Color Coding by Technician (NOT by status)

Remove status-based background colors (red/green/others) from jobs.

Implement color coding by technician instead:

Each technician gets a distinct soft color (background or left border).

Example: Tech A = blue tint, Tech B = green tint, Tech C = purple tint, etc.

Maintain good contrast for text.

Add a small technician legend somewhere above or below the calendar:

e.g. ● Mikel – Blue | ● Nad – Green | ● Solomon – Purple

2.3 Technician Filtering / Compare

At the top of the calendar, update the “All Technicians” selector to support three modes:

All Technicians – show all jobs (current default).

Single Technician – user selects one tech; show only that technician’s jobs.

Compare – user can select multiple technicians, and their jobs appear together, using the technician color coding.

(Use whatever UI pattern fits best with our existing select component: multi-select dropdown or segmented control.)

2.4 Drag and Drop Behavior

Keep drag-and-drop scheduling:

Drag from Unscheduled → calendar to assign date/time.

Drag between days/time slots to reschedule.

If drag-and-drop is already implemented, make sure the new layout doesn’t break it and that the drop zones are still easy to hit.

3. Business Logic & Features
3.1 Start Time & Time Scale Controls

At the top of the weekly calendar, add a Start Time control:

Allow the user to choose the first visible time for the day column (e.g. 5AM, 6AM, 7AM, 8AM).

Remember their choice (per user) if we already have a place for user preferences; otherwise, keep it in local state for now.

Add a time increment selector:

Options: 15 min, 30 min, 60 min.

This changes the vertical grid spacing.

3.2 Remove “Optimize Route”

Remove the “Optimize Route” button from the calendar header for now.

Make sure removing this button doesn’t break layout spacing; adjust the header alignment accordingly.

3.3 Week Parts Button (KEEP, but no hard requirement logic)

Keep the existing Week Parts button / feature, but:

Do not make parts mandatory for scheduling.

Do not block scheduling if parts are missing.

Do not color jobs based on parts readiness.

Week Parts is purely informational, based on currently scheduled jobs for that week.

3.4 Unscheduled Jobs Behavior

Unscheduled jobs should persist in the right drawer across week and month changes until they are scheduled.

Each unscheduled job tile should:

Show client name.

Show the originally intended or due date (like “Nov 25”) so we can see that it’s overdue.

Use a consistent, subtle style (no technician color-coding here; these are unscheduled).

4. Status, Titles, and Header Clean-up

At the top of the job detail header on calendar pages, there’s currently duplicate job information:

Example: “Jobs / #10134” and another “Job #10134” label below it.

Remove the duplicate and keep only one clear breadcrumb + title.

On the calendar itself:

Keep the date range display (e.g. “December 8–14, 2025”).

Keep the “Today” button.

Keep toggles for Weekly / Monthly.

Remove any redundant status label that repeats the same information that’s already in the job tile or details panel.

5. Accessibility & Readability

Ensure all text meets accessible contrast ratios against backgrounds, especially for technician colors.

Make sure font sizes in job cards and unscheduled items are at least as large as the improved font sizes we used on the Jobs and Clients pages.

When the user changes the global font size (e.g. the “A / A Large” control in the header), calendar job cards and unscheduled list should respect that setting.

6. Implementation Notes

Update the existing calendar components rather than creating entirely new ones. Look for files like:

CalendarPage.tsx / Calendar.tsx

WeekView.tsx / MonthView.tsx

UnscheduledPanel.tsx or similar

Centralize the technician color mapping in a shared utility or config so the same colors can be reused later in other views (e.g., job list, technician management).

Carefully adjust Tailwind / CSS classes to:

Reduce horizontal/vertical gaps.

Control density based on the Compact/Comfortable/Expanded setting.

After changes, verify:

Weekly view still scrolls correctly vertically.

Monthly view still scrolls vertically when needed.

Drag-and-drop works at different densities and time increments.

The UI is responsive on smaller laptop viewports.

Deliverable:
Refactored weekly and monthly calendar views with:

Narrower left sidebar and right unscheduled drawer (collapsible),

Wider central calendar grid,

Technician-based color coding,

Improved job card layout,

Start time + time increment controls,

Removed Optimize Route,

Non-blocking parts logic,

Technician filter with multi-compare,

Cleaned up headers and duplication.

Please implement all of the above and then summarize what files you changed and how the new behavior works.
