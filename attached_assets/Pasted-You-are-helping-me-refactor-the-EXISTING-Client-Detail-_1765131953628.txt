You are helping me refactor the EXISTING Client Detail page in my app.

Right now this page (for example “Basil Box ▸ Ryerson”) has:
- Left sidebar nav (Dashboard, Calendar, Jobs, Clients, Products & Services, Reports, Manage Team, Admin)
- Top area with client name and a location
- Tabs: Overview | Locations | Parts | Notes
- Two main cards on the Overview tab: “Company Information” and “Primary Location”
- A “Quick Actions” section with buttons like “Manage Locations”, “View Parts”, “Create Invoice”

Use the existing frontend stack, routing, and UI components. Do NOT introduce new frameworks. Refactor the current page/component instead of rewriting it from scratch.

The main goal: make this page **workflow-first** (create jobs, manage work, bill) while still showing essential client info. It also needs to handle **multiple locations per client** gracefully.

------------------------------------------------
HIGH-LEVEL GOALS
------------------------------------------------

1. Add a **Jobs** tab to the client page so users can see and filter all jobs for that client.
2. Support **multiple locations per client** by allowing the Jobs tab to filter by location.
3. Move **Quick Actions** (Create Job, Create Invoice, Add Location) to the top so they are immediately visible.
4. Keep the existing clean style and the QuickBooks-compatible model (Company ↔ QBO Customer, Location ↔ QBO Sub-Customer).

------------------------------------------------
1) TABS: ADD A “JOBS” TAB
------------------------------------------------

Currently the tabs are: Overview | Locations | Parts | Notes.

Change them to:

- Overview
- Jobs
- Locations
- Parts
- Notes

Use the existing tab component / pattern used on this page.

When the user clicks **Jobs**:

- Show a jobs area for this specific client (see details below).
- Keep using the same route (e.g. /clients/:id) but with tab state handled as it is today (or with a query param like ?tab=jobs if that is supported).

------------------------------------------------
2) JOBS TAB – SUPPORT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS
------------------------------------------------

Create a new Jobs tab component (e.g. `ClientJobsTab`) with the following behavior:

### Layout

At the top of the Jobs tab:

1. A **header row** with:
   - Title: “Jobs”
   - A primary button: “Create Job”

2. A **Location filter**:

   - A dropdown or pill selector that allows:
     - “All Locations”
     - One option per Location belonging to this Company

   Example:
     - Location: [ All Locations ▼ ]
       - All Locations
       - Ryerson
       - Yonge & Finch
       - Scarborough

Below that, show a table or list of jobs for this client.

### Data

- Fetch jobs for this specific client (companyId) via the existing jobs API layer or create a new endpoint if needed.
- Each job row should display at least:
  - Job number or ID
  - Summary/Title
  - Assigned Technician (or team)
  - **Location Name** (important)
  - Status
  - Scheduled Date/Time

### Filtering

- When `Location = All Locations`:
  - Show all jobs for this client (all locations).
- When a specific location is selected:
  - Show only jobs for that `locationId`.

Ensure the UI visually indicates the location for each job (e.g. a badge or a column called “Location”).

### Create Job button (for now)

- For now, wire “Create Job” to open whatever existing job-creation flow is present (page or modal).
- It should pre-fill the `companyId` = this client’s ID.
- If the Location filter is set to a specific location when “Create Job” is clicked:
  - Also prefill `locationId` to that selected location (if the job creation flow supports it).
- If the job system is not fully implemented yet, you can still stub this button to just call a placeholder function or route.

------------------------------------------------
3) LINKING LOCATIONS → JOBS
------------------------------------------------

On the **Locations** tab:

- For each location row/card, add an action: **“View Jobs”**.
- When the user clicks “View Jobs” for a given location:
  - Navigate to the **same client detail route** but with:
    - The **Jobs** tab active.
    - The **Location filter pre-selected** to that location.

Implementation detail:

- Use the existing router (e.g., /clients/:id?tab=jobs&locationId=<locationId>).
- The Jobs tab should read `locationId` from the route/query (or from props) and initialize the Location filter accordingly.

This makes the flow:

- Client → Locations tab → click “View Jobs” on Ryerson → Client → Jobs tab opens with Location = Ryerson and only Ryerson jobs visible.

------------------------------------------------
4) MOVE QUICK ACTIONS TO THE TOP (WORKFLOW-FIRST)
------------------------------------------------

Currently “Quick Actions” is a card lower down on the Overview tab.

Refactor so that:

- Near the top of the client detail page (close to the title “Basil Box ▸ Ryerson”), add a **primary actions group** of buttons.

These should include, in roughly this order:

1. **Create Job**
2. **Create Invoice**
3. **Add Location**

Use the existing button styles (same look as the “+ Add Client” button in the header).

Behavior:

- These buttons should be available regardless of which tab is active (the actions belong to the client as a whole).
- You can either:
  - Place them in the top-right area of the main content header, OR
  - Place them just under the client name in a horizontal row.

“Quick Actions” as a separate card can be removed or reduced, since its main purpose is now handled by the top actions.

------------------------------------------------
5) OVERVIEW TAB – KEEP INFO, PREPARE FOR ACTIVITY
------------------------------------------------

Keep the two main cards on the Overview tab:

1. **Company Information** card:
   - Company Name
   - Small subtitle indicating that it maps to QuickBooks Customer.
   - “View All Locations” button linking to the Locations tab.

2. **Primary Location** card:
   - Primary location name
   - Small subtitle indicating that it maps to QuickBooks Sub-Customer.
   - A badge or label for billing behavior:
     - “Bills to Parent” or “Bills to This Location”
   - A short line like:
     - “Invoices for this location will be billed to the parent company.”
     - or “Invoices for this location will be billed directly to this location.”

Below or alongside these, add a placeholder card such as “Activity Summary” for future use:

- For now, this can simply say:
  - “Jobs: coming soon”
  - “Unpaid invoices: coming soon”
- The point is to reserve space for operational metrics later, not to fully implement them now.

------------------------------------------------
6) TECH NOTES & CONSTRAINTS
------------------------------------------------

- Do not expose or allow editing of QuickBooks IDs (qboCustomerId, qboParentCustomerId, etc.) on this page.
- Do not break the existing parent/child mapping:
  - Company = QBO Customer
  - Location = QBO Sub-Customer
- Keep the layout responsive and consistent with existing spacing/typography.

------------------------------------------------
WHAT TO DELIVER
------------------------------------------------

Please update the existing Client Detail page implementation to:

1. Change tabs to: Overview | Jobs | Locations | Parts | Notes.
2. Implement the Jobs tab with:
   - Create Job button
   - Location filter (All Locations + individual locations)
   - Job list with Location column/badge.
3. Add “View Jobs” actions on Locations tab that open the Jobs tab with the appropriate location filter selected.
4. Move Quick Actions (Create Job, Create Invoice, Add Location) to the top of the page near the client title as a primary action group.
5. Keep the Company and Primary Location cards on the Overview tab, and add a simple Activity Summary placeholder card.

Use the same code style, components, and routing patterns that already exist in the project.
