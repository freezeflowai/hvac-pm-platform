You are a senior React + TypeScript + Tailwind dev.
I already have a working Calendar with weekly view, unscheduled drawer, and a Parts button. I need you to fix some specific UX/layout issues.
Do not change any core business logic or drag-and-drop behavior.

1. Fix Parts button behavior (week vs individual days)

Right now the Parts button shows parts for the whole week only. I need a clear filter so I can see parts per week or per specific day.

Requirements:

Keep the existing Parts button in the calendar toolbar (near the technicians filter and location filter).

When the user clicks Parts, open a modal (or side panel) with:

Title: Parts for this schedule

A row of filter chips or buttons at the top:

First chip: This Week

Then one chip for each visible day in the current view, e.g. Mon 8, Tue 9, etc.

Behavior:

Default selection should be This Week (current behavior: all visible week jobs).

When This Week is selected, show the full week parts list grouped by date.

When a day chip is selected, show only parts for that specific day.

Reuse the existing parts aggregation logic you already have for the week pills; just scope it by date when a day is selected.

Keep this modal strictly read-only for now; no editing required.

Make sure closing the modal (X button or Close button) resets nothing else in the calendar.

2. Fix All-Day vs time row alignment

The grid is still slightly misaligned: the vertical line between the “All Day” row and the time rows (7 AM, 8 AM, etc.) is not perfectly continuous.

Requirements:

Find the calendar layout where:

The All Day row is rendered.

The time rows (7 AM, 8 AM, …) and day columns are rendered.

Ensure that All Day + all time rows share the exact same grid definition:

They must use the same parent grid container or share the same grid-template-columns class.

There should be no extra ml-*, mr-*, pl-*, or pr-* on either the All Day row or the time rows that shift the columns.

If the All Day row currently has its own wrapper, refactor so that:

There is a single grid container that renders:

Row 0: All Day

Row 1+: each time slot

Or both share a reusable CSS/Tailwind class that guarantees the same grid-template-columns and column gaps.

Visually verify after changes: the vertical borders under each weekday must be perfectly straight from the All Day row down through all time rows.

3. Use full width between sidebar and right edge

The calendar still has large outer gaps. It should behave more like Jobber: the grid nearly touches the content edges.

Requirements:

Find the top-level container wrapping the calendar (not the global sidebar).

Remove or reduce any:

max-w-* constraints that keep it narrow.

Large horizontal mx-* or px-* that create big gutters.

Desired behavior:

The calendar grid should start just after the left sidebar with only a small padding (e.g. px-3 or px-4 on the main content, not big gaps).

The Unscheduled drawer should sit very close to the right viewport edge, again with only minimal padding.

Keep responsiveness:

On smaller screens it’s okay if the calendar scrolls horizontally, but on desktop it should stretch almost full width.

4. Color logic: technician colors vs overdue indicator

Right now I like the red dot and the colored vertical line, but the meanings need to be separated:

Red dot = overdue job

Vertical colored line = technician color (who the job is assigned to)

Also, in the unscheduled drawer the “Nov 25” pill in the top-right is redundant.

Requirements:

4.1 Job cards inside the calendar grid

Each job card inside the calendar cells should have:

A thin vertical bar (left side) whose color is based on the assigned technician.

Use the technician’s assigned color (from existing technician config).

If no technician is assigned, use a neutral gray.

A small red dot somewhere near the top-right or near the title only if the job is overdue.

Overdue = whatever status flag you already use; reuse existing logic.

Make sure overdue styling does NOT override technician color:

The vertical bar must always show the technician’s color.

Overdue is indicated only by the red dot and/or subtle text, not by changing the bar color.

Do not re-introduce big “Overdue/Scheduled” badges on the card itself; keep the cards clean and compact (title + short description).

4.2 Unscheduled drawer cards

Each unscheduled card should:

Use a technician-color vertical bar on the left, exactly like the calendar cards.

If overdue, show a red dot (same style as the main grid) in a consistent spot on the card.

Remove the top-right date pill (e.g., the small “Nov 25” badge).

Keep only the bottom text line which already says something like “Overdue Nov 25” or “Due Nov 25”.

This unclutters the card and frees horizontal space.

Make sure overdue styling does not override the technician color; same rules as above.

5. Keep existing filters but don’t change their behavior

You will see filters like:

Technicians filter

Location filter (just added)

Start time selector

Density dropdown (Dens Comfort etc.)

Weekly/Monthly toggle

Important:
Do not alter their logic. You may adjust spacing slightly to keep the toolbar neat, but the behavior must remain unchanged.

6. Summary

At the end, please:

List which files you changed (Calendar layout, Parts modal, JobCard component, Unscheduled drawer, etc.).

Briefly describe how you:

Implemented the Parts modal filters (week vs days),

Fixed the grid alignment and width,

Implemented technician color bars + overdue red dots,

Removed the duplicate date pill from unscheduled cards.
